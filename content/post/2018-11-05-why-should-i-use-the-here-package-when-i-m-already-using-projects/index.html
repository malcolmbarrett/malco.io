<h2>TL;DR: Why should I use <code>here</code>?</h2>
<ul>
<li>The <code>here</code> package makes it easier to use sub-directories within projects</li>
<li>It’s robust to other ways people open and run your code</li>
<li>Like its base R cousin, <code>file.path()</code>, it writes paths safely across operating systems</li>
</ul>
<p>Like a lot of people, when I learned R, I was taught to put <code>setwd()</code> and <code>rm(list = ls())</code> at the beginning of scripts. Getting rid of any leftovers in the environment and setting the working directory so I can use relative paths made sense to me. It seemed like good practice! But <code>setwd()</code> and <code>rm(list = ls())</code> are problematic. <code>rm()</code> doesn’t actually give you a clean R session; it doesn’t, for instance, detach packages. <code>setwd()</code>, meanwhile, is completely dependent on the way you organize your files. If you set a working directory that is an absolute path on your computer, it will only run for someone else if they rewrite the absolute path to where it is on <em>their</em> computer.</p>
<p>Last year, Jenny Bryan shared some slides from a talk on this subject. I’ll let them speak for themselves:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>If the first line of your R script is</em></p>
<p><code>setwd(&quot;C:\Users\jenny\path\that\only\I\have&quot;)</code></p>
<p><em>I will come into your office and SET YOUR COMPUTER ON FIRE</em> 🔥.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>If the first line of your R script is</em></p>
<p><code>rm(list = ls())</code></p>
<p><em>I will come into your office and SET YOUR COMPUTER ON FIRE</em> 🔥.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you haven’t read <a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/articles/2017/12/workflow-vs-script/">her write-up on what the issues and solutions are</a>, you should. Here’s the basic idea:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use Rstudio projects. They set up a local working directory in a fresh R session, which makes it much easier for someone else to open</li>
<li>Use <code>here()</code> from the <code>here</code> package to write file paths</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etkSsF6r2iU">Setting up a project is easy</a><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>. Projects can handle both of the problems <code>setwd()</code> and <code>rm(list = ls())</code> are trying to solve for you. You can <a href="https://community.rstudio.com/t/first-line-of-every-r-script/799/11">set it so you have a fresh R session when opening a project</a> (either locally in the project or globally in Rstudio). Additionally, when you’re in a project, you don’t need to set your working directory. The working directory is just wherever the project is.</p>
<p>So, it may not be obvious: what’s the benefit of using the <code>here</code> package if projects solve both those problems?</p>

<div id="whats-under-here" class="section level1">
<h1>What’s under here?</h1>
<p>It may seem like <code>here</code> is just pasting paths together for you, but let’s look at what it’s actually doing. The <code>here</code> package is essentially a wrapper for the <code>rprojroot</code> package. <code>rprojroot</code> is a powerful tool for working with project directories, but <code>here</code> offers a simpler set of functions that take care of its main purpose: detecting the root directory and working with paths within it in a platform-independent way.</p>
<p>If you use <code>here()</code>, it will tell you your project root directory, which will look something like this.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(here)
here()</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>## here() starts at /Users/malcolmbarrett/folders/to/directory/
## [1] &quot;/Users/malcolmbarrett/folders/to/directory/&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Essentially, <code>here()</code> is looking around for a few things that signify a root directory, like a <code>.Rproj</code> project file. <code>here</code> also has a function, <code>set_here()</code>, that will tag a directory as root using a <code>.here</code> file, even if it’s not a project. In fact, <code>.here</code> files take priority, then <code>.Rproj</code> files, followed by several other file formats (see the documentation at <code>?here</code>). The last resort is the working directory. If you’re not sure why <code>here</code> is picking a root directory, you can ask it to explain itself using <code>dr_here()</code></p>
<pre class="r"><code>dr_here()</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>## here() starts at /Users/malcolmbarrett/folders/to/directory/, because it contains a file matching `[.]Rproj$` with contents matching `^Version: ` in the first line</code></pre>
<p><code>here()</code> also works a lot like <code>file.path()</code> in that it will create a platform-independent path for you (e.g. it will work on Windows and Mac alike). On my Mac, it looks something like this:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>here(&quot;figure&quot;, &quot;figure.png&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>## [1] &quot;/Users/malcolmbarrett/folders/to/directory/figure/figure.png&quot;</code></pre>
<div id="i-have-a-project.-why-not-just-use-relative-paths" class="section level2">
<h2>I have a project. Why not just use relative paths?</h2>
<p>I already touched on one reason to avoid writing paths yourself: the rules aren’t necessarily the same between operating systems. You could, of course, use <code>file.path()</code> from base R, which safely creates a relative path for you.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>file.path(&quot;figure&quot;, &quot;figure.png&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>## [1] &quot;figure/figure.png&quot;</code></pre>
<p>But <code>here</code> has some added benefits: it makes it easier to manage sub-directories, and it makes your code more robust outside of projects. <a href="https://github.com/malcolmbarrett/here_here">As an example, I’ve set up an R project on my GitHub</a> that has a file directory like this:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>here_here
|--data
    |--mtcars.csv
|--figs
    |--mpg_hp.png
|--rmd
    |--01_read_data.Rmd
    |--01_read_data.pdf
|--scripts
    |--read_data.R
|--here_here.Rproj</code></pre>
<p>In <code>rmd/01_read_data.Rmd</code>, I try to call the data using a relative path from the root directory, but Rmarkdown sets a local working directory, so it fails:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(tidyverse)
read_csv(&quot;data/mtcars.csv&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>## Error: &#39;data/mtcars.csv&#39; does not exist in current working directory</code></pre>
<p>I can solve this with some of the usual wonky backtracking, e.g. <code>../data/mtcars.csv</code>, but <code>here()</code> will take care if it for me by finding the project directory:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>read_csv(here(&quot;data&quot;, &quot;mtcars.csv&quot;))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 32 x 11
##      mpg   cyl  disp    hp  drat    wt  qsec    vs    am  gear  carb

## # … with 22 more rows</code></pre>
<p>It works with no trouble. Likewise, saving output to other sub-directories is no issue:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(mtcars, aes(mpg, hp)) + geom_point()</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2018-11-05-why-should-i-use-the-here-package-when-i-m-already-using-projects/index_files/figure-html/makee_ggplot-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggsave(here(&quot;figs&quot;, &quot;mpg_hp.png&quot;))</code></pre>
<p>Which puts it in the <code>figs</code> folder despite being called from the <code>rmd</code> folder.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>|--figs
    |--mpg_hp.png</code></pre>
<p>This is nice, as well, because if I move a file, I don’t need to change the relative directory: it works from the root up.</p>
<p>Another benefit is that, if I open any of these files outside of an Rstudio project, they will still run. For Rmarkdown files, using a relative path may be fine because it sets a local working directory when running, but <code>.R</code> files don’t. If you open <code>scripts/read_data.R</code> in a different Rstudio session, for instance, the relative path fails, but <code>here()</code> still works fine. That’s because it knows where the right directory is based on the <code>.Rproj</code> file.</p>
<p><img src="https://malco.io/img/outside_project.gif" /></p>
<p>Likewise, if you or someone else sets a working directory within your project, <code>here</code> will still work correctly because project directories take precedence. If you need to manually change it for some reason, it’s better in this case to use <code>set_here()</code>.</p>

<h2>More than a path paster</h2>
<p><code>here</code> is one of the many tools in our toolkit for addressing reproducibility. Because it’s designed to work with Rstudio projects, it’s a natural tool to use within them. <code>here</code> is also robust to other ways people run your code. If that doesn’t convince you, you can at least sleep soundly knowing that your computer will live another day.</p>
